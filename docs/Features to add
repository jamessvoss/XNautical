In the downloads sections have it show how much space Xnautical is currently using
and how much free space is available
Add a button for real-time tide values on the depth soundings adjusted for local tide values
Get routing, save waypoint, all that stuff Done 
Get live buoys on main map page

I really like the feature that when you rotate the compass it puts up
a full screen direction line that moves as you rotate
